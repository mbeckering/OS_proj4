OS Project 4: Process scheduler simulation
One round-robin queue for real-time processes
One three-level feedback queue
One blocked queue

Reading log output:
In order to find rarer events, I suggest ctrl+f-ing the log for keywords such
as "blocked", "waking", and "queue 0" (to identify real-time processes).
Statistics are shown at the very end. I may also print stats to stdout.

Globals:
I used a LOT of globals in order to delegate more work to functions. The last 
couple projects got very long and I found myself scrolling through lots of 
code and struggling to find my core operations. I know over-using globals is 
generally a bad thing, but I thought I would experiment this time around. It
worked well, but feels dirty.

Message Queue:
One message queue serves as both communications channel and ensures only 
one executable is "running" at a time, either a user or the OSS.
OSS sends user messages of mytpe (1-18), representing the simulated pid of the 
intended user recipient. User messages to the OSS are of type 99. This way 
OSS never grabs messages that it put in the queue.
