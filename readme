Globals:
I used a LOT of globals in order to delegate more work to functions. The last 
couple projects got very long and I found myself scrolling through lots of 
code and struggling to find my core operations. I know over-using globals is 
generally a bad thing, but I thought I would experiment this time around.

Message Queues:
OSS sends user messages of mytpe (1-18), representing the simulated pid of the 
intended user recipient. User messages to the OSS are of type 99. This way 
OSS never grabs messages that it put in the queue.
